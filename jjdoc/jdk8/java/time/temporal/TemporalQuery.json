{"name":"TemporalQuery","comment":"Strategy for querying a temporal object.\n \u003cp\u003e\n Queries are a key tool for extracting information from temporal objects.\n They exist to externalize the process of querying, permitting different\n approaches, as per the strategy design pattern.\n Examples might be a query that checks if the date is the day before February 29th\n in a leap year, or calculates the number of days to your next birthday.\n \u003cp\u003e\n The {@link TemporalField} interface provides another mechanism for querying\n temporal objects.
