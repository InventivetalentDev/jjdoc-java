The default value is platform-dependent.\n The usage threshold can be set via the\n {@link #setUsageThreshold setUsageThreshold} method.\n If the threshold is set to a positive value, the usage threshold crossing\n checking is enabled in this memory pool.\n If the usage threshold is set to zero, usage\n threshold crossing checking on this memory pool is disabled.\n The {@link MemoryPoolMXBean#isUsageThresholdSupported} method can\n be used to determine if this functionality is supported.\n \u003cp\u003e\n A Java virtual machine performs usage threshold crossing checking on a\n memory pool basis at its best appropriate time, typically,\n at garbage collection time.\n Each memory pool maintains a {@link #getUsageThresholdCount\n usage threshold count} that will get incremented\n every time when the Java virtual machine\n detects that the memory pool usage is crossing the threshold.\n \u003cp\u003e\n This manageable usage threshold attribute is designed for monitoring the\n increasing trend of memory usage with low overhead.\n Usage threshold may not be appropriate for some memory pools.\n For example, a generational garbage collector, a common garbage collection\n algorithm used in many Java virtual machine implementations,\n manages two or more generations segregating objects by age.\n Most of the objects are allocated in\n the \u003cem\u003eyoungest generation\u003c/em\u003e (say a nursery memory pool).\n The nursery memory pool is designed to be filled up and\n collecting the nursery memory pool will free most of its memory space\n since it is expected to contain mostly short-lived objects\n and mostly are unreachable at garbage collection time.\n In this case, it is more appropriate for the nursery memory pool\n not to support a usage threshold.  In addition,\n if the cost of an object allocation\n in one memory pool is very low (for example, just atomic pointer exchange),\n the Java virtual machine would probably not support the usage threshold\n for that memory pool since the overhead in comparing the usage with\n the threshold is higher than the cost of object allocation.\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n The memory usage of the system can be monitored using\n \u003ca href\u003d\"#Polling\"\u003epolling\u003c/a\u003e or\n \u003ca href\u003d\"#ThresholdNotification\"\u003ethreshold notification\u003c/a\u003e mechanisms.\n\n \u003col type\u003d\"a\"\u003e\n   \u003cli\u003e\u003ca name\u003d\"Polling\"\u003e\u003cb\u003ePolling\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n       \u003cp\u003e\n       An application can continuously monitor its memory usage\n       by calling either the {@link #getUsage} method for all\n       memory pools or the {@link #isUsageThresholdExceeded} method\n       for those memory pools that support a usage threshold.\n       Below is example code that has a thread dedicated for\n       task distribution and processing.
