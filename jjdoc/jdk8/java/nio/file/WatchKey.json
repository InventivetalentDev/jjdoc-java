{"name":"WatchKey","comment":"A token representing the registration of a {@link Watchable watchable} object\n with a {@link WatchService}.\n\n \u003cp\u003e A watch key is created when a watchable object is registered with a watch\n service. The key remains {@link #isValid valid} until:\n \u003col\u003e\n   \u003cli\u003e It is cancelled, explicitly, by invoking its {@link #cancel cancel}\n     method, or\u003c/li\u003e\n   \u003cli\u003e Cancelled implicitly, because the object is no longer accessible,\n     or \u003c/li\u003e\n   \u003cli\u003e By {@link WatchService#close closing} the watch service. \u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ol\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e A watch key has a state. When initially created the key is said to be\n \u003cem\u003eready\u003c/em\u003e. When an event is detected then the key is \u003cem\u003esignalled\u003c/em\u003e\n and queued so that it can be retrieved by invoking the watch service\u0027s {@link\n WatchService#poll() poll} or {@link WatchService#take() take} methods. Once\n signalled, a key remains in this state until its {@link #reset reset} method\n is invoked to return the key to the ready state. Events detected while the\n key is in the signalled state are queued but do not cause the key to be\n re-queued for retrieval from the watch service. Events are retrieved by\n invoking the key\u0027s {@link #pollEvents pollEvents} method. This method\n retrieves and removes all events accumulated for the object. When initially\n created, a watch key has no pending events. Typically events are retrieved\n when the key is in the signalled state leading to the following idiom:\n\n \u003cpre\u003e\n     for (;;) {\n         // retrieve key\n         WatchKey key \u003d watcher.take();\n\n         // process events\n         for (WatchEvent\u0026lt;?\u0026gt; event: key.pollEvents()) {\n             :\n         }\n\n         // reset the key\n         boolean valid \u003d key.reset();\n         if (!valid) {\n             // object no longer registered\n         }\n     }\n \u003c/pre\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003e Watch keys are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. Where there\n are several threads retrieving signalled keys from a watch service then care\n should be taken to ensure that the {@code reset} method is only invoked after\n the events for the object have been processed. This ensures that one thread\n is processing the events for an object at any time.","isClass":false,"isInterface":true,"isEnum":false,"isEnumConstant":false,"isConstructor":false,"isField":false,"isMethod":false,"isOrdinaryClass":false,"isPrimitive":false,"simpleName":"WatchKey","qualifiedName":"java.nio.file.WatchKey","dimension":"","elementType":{},"package":"java.nio.file","interfaces":[],"isAbstract":true,"isStatic":false,"since":"1.7","innerClasses":[],"isInnerClass":false,"constructors":[],"fields":[],"methods":[{"name":"isValid","comment":"Tells whether or not this watch key is valid.\n\n \u003cp\u003e A watch key is valid upon creation and remains until it is cancelled,\n or its watch service is closed.","isClass":false,"isInterface":false,"isEnum":false,"isEnumConstant":false,"isConstructor":false,"isField":false,"isMethod":true,"isOrdinaryClass":false,"signature":"()","flatSignature":"()","returnType":{"isPrimitive":true,"simpleName":"boolean","qualifiedName":"boolean","dimension":"","elementType":{}},"isAbstract":true,"isDefault":false,"isStatic":false,"parameters":[],"typeParameters":[]},{"name":"pollEvents","comment":"Retrieves and removes all pending events for this watch key, returning\n a {@code List} of the events that were retrieved.\n\n \u003cp\u003e Note that this method does not wait if there are no events pending.","isClass":false,"isInterface":false,"isEnum":false,"isEnumConstant":false,"isConstructor":false,"isField":false,"isMethod":true,"isOrdinaryClass":false,"signature":"()","flatSignature":"()","returnType":{"isPrimitive":false,"simpleName":"List","qualifiedName":"java.util.List","dimension":"","elementType":{}},"isAbstract":true,"isDefault":false,"isStatic":false,"parameters":[],"typeParameters":[]},{"name":"reset","comment":"Resets this watch key.\n\n \u003cp\u003e If this watch key has been cancelled or this watch key is already in\n the ready state then invoking this method has no effect.
