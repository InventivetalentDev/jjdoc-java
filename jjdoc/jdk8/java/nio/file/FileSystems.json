Installed providers are loaded using the\n service-provider loading facility defined by the {@link ServiceLoader} class.\n Installed providers are loaded using the system class loader. If the\n system class loader cannot be found then the extension class loader is used;\n if there is no extension class loader then the bootstrap class loader is used.\n Providers are typically installed by placing them in a JAR file on the\n application class path or in the extension directory, the JAR file contains a\n provider-configuration file named {@code java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider}\n in the resource directory {@code META-INF/services}, and the file lists one or\n more fully-qualified names of concrete subclass of {@link FileSystemProvider}\n that have a zero argument constructor.\n The ordering that installed providers are located is implementation specific.\n If a provider is instantiated and its {@link FileSystemProvider#getScheme()\n getScheme} returns the same URI scheme of a provider that was previously\n instantiated then the most recently instantiated duplicate is discarded. URI\n schemes are compared without regard to case. During construction a provider\n may safely access files associated with the default provider but care needs\n to be taken to avoid circular loading of other installed providers.
